\section{Setting up the differential equation}
Beginning with newtons second law for an object falling  with quadratic  air resistance and a source term for verification.
\begin{equation}
	\sum F = m\ddot{x}
\end{equation}

% note to self: What is a source term, which is given in the exercise

\begin{equation}
	mg - b\dot{x}|\dot{x}| + F_s = m\ddot{x}
\end{equation}
Or, written in terms of velocity.
\begin{equation}
	mg- bv|v| + F_s = m\dot{v}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\dot{v} = g - \frac{b}{m}v|v| + F_s = f(t, v)
\end{equation}

\section{Setting up the discrete equation} % (fold)
\label{sec:setting_up_the_discrete_equation}

We choose the Crank-Nicholson scheme for discretizing the equation. 
\begin{equation}
	[D_t v = f(t, \bar{v}^{t, \theta})]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
To linearize the equation, we decide to take the geometric average of the velocities in $|v|v$, such that:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{v^{n+1} - v^{n}}{\Delta t} = g - \frac{b}{m}|v^n|v^{n+1} + F_s
\end{equation}
This gives a linear equation in $v^{n+1}$, which makes it easier to handle with an implicit solver. Solving this equation for $v^{n+1}$ gives:
\begin{equation}
	v^{n+1} = \frac{v^n + (g +F_s)\Delta t}{1+\frac{b}{m}|v^n|\Delta t}
\end{equation}
